A **software engineer** and **filmmaker** in NYC.
<!-- And [here's my repo!](https://github.com/kdevo/osprey-delight) -->

My work is where the physical and digital worlds meet.

VR, virtual production, real-time rendering, robotics.

```js
languages = ['python', 'c++', 'c#', 'java', 'javascript', 'sql']
frameworks = ['ros', '.net', 'react', 'react-native', 'ef6']
engines = ['unity', 'unreal engine']
```

Osprey **De**light is a sugar-free version of the [awesome Osprey theme](https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey) by [Toma Nistor](https://tomanistor.com/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It tastes a bit different than the original (hence the "light" in the name) but also adds some new functionality -- hopefully to your **delight**.

Have fun using it! {{< icon "rocket icon-pulse-fast" >}}
