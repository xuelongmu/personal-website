Healios provides effective and accessible mental health care, focusing on recovery after traumatic experiences.

This prototype for a mental health treatment platform was a Global Finalist at the 2019 IBM Call for Code competition. Healios placed 4th overall out of 5000+ projects and 180,000+ participants.
