With the same team from Antifreeze, I’ve been working on a multiplayer action RPG prototype. We’re using Steam networking and the Unreal Engine Gameplay Ability System (used in Fortnite and Paragon) to create a fast-paced multiplayer gameplay experience. In the video below, we show our first PvP match-based game mode, a classic free-for-all. In the future we plan to add more game modes including PvE missions, more classes, and upgrade trees.
