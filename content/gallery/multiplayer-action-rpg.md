With the same team from Antifreeze, Iâ€™ve been working on a fast-paced multiplayer action RPG with the following features:

- Steam networking with Online Subsystem for session hosting, server lists, and session joining
- Gameplay Ability System (used in Fortnite and Paragon) for replicated, server-authoritative abilities including magic spells and melee attacks

In the video below, we show our first PvP match-based game mode, a classic free-for-all. In the future we plan to add more game modes including PvE missions, more classes, and upgrade trees.
