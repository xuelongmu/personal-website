For my senior design project in the Mechanical Engineering major at Columbia University, my team designed, built, and programmed a 4-axis robot that could throw pottery. We used two end effectors, shaped like a palm and a finger, to press the clay into pre-programmed shapes including a vase, cup, and bowl.
