With the same team from Antifreeze, I’ve been working on a multiplayer action RPG prototype. We’ve used a lot of pre-existing assets and connected them together to create a dynamic melee and ranged combat system, fluid player movement, and a classic RPG inventory system. Although it’s not far along enough to show yet, I’m currently integrating Epic Online Services to create multiplayer matchmaking and lobby systems.
