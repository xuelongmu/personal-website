Iâ€™ve been working on a fast-paced multiplayer action RPG in UE4 with the following features:

- Steam networking using Online Subsystem for session hosting, server lists, and session joining
- Replicated, server-authoritative abilities and effects including magic spells, melee attacks, and debuff indicators, powered by the Gameplay Ability System (used in Fortnite)
- Clean UI with leaderboard, damage indicators, spell availability icons, and health/mana bars

The video below shows a PvP deathmatch game mode. In the future I plan to add more game modes including PvE missions, more classes, and upgrade systems.
