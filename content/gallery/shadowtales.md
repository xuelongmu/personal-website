Iâ€™ve been working on a fast-paced multiplayer action RPG with the following features:

- Steam networking with Online Subsystem for session hosting, server lists, and session joining
- Gameplay Ability System (used in Fortnite and Paragon) for replicated, server-authoritative abilities including magic spells and melee attacks
- Clean HUD with damage indicator, leaderboard, spell affordance icons, and health/mana bars

The video below shows a PvP deathmatch game mode. In the future we plan to add more game modes including PvE missions, more classes, and upgrade systems.
