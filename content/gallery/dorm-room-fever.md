Dorm Room Fever is a first person adventure / stealth game titled Dorm Room Fever where you play as a college student who's under travel quarantine after moving into the dorms. It's a tongue-in-cheek take on the 2020 college experience, and I had a lot of fun making it!

I programmed the game in 100% Blueprints over the course of a week, and worked with two other devs who handled environment/character art and game design.

Itâ€™s currently available for free download on [itch.io](https://xuelongmu.itch.io/dorm-room-fever). You can also check out this gameplay clip.
