Dorm Room Fever is a first person adventure / stealth game where you play as a college student who's under travel quarantine after moving into the dorms. It's a tongue-in-cheek take on the 2020 college experience, when many students were placed under strict restrictions and subpar living conditions.

I programmed the game in 100% Blueprints in UE4 over the course of a week, as an entry for the Epic 2020 MegaJam. I worked with two other devs who handled environment/character art and game design.

The latest build is currently available for free download on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ThPktWQ0-Vqbz7ejhakTcB8VD4JyaUaL/view?usp=sharing). You can also check out this gameplay clip.
