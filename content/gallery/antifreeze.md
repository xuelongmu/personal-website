I developed an FPS movement puzzler for the Unreal Spring Game Jam in June 2020. Titled Antifreeze, the core mechanic is freezing or melting objects using a Portal-inspired gun. The game was developed over the course of five days with a team of three developers including myself, and itâ€™s currently available for free download on itch.io (click the view button below). I also uploaded a gameplay clip on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/K_tY-JsjjjQ).
