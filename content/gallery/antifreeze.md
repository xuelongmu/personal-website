I developed Antifreeze, an FPS movement puzzler, for the Unreal Spring Game Jam in June 2020. The core mechanic is freezing or melting objects using a Portal-inspired gun. I was responsible for the following aspects:

- Environmental interaction using Blueprint Interfaces
- Material shaders for water, ice, and freezing transition
- Level design

The game was developed over the course of five days in UE4 with a team of three developers including myself, and itâ€™s currently available for free download on [itch.io](https://xuelongmu.itch.io/antifreeze). You can also check out this gameplay clip.
