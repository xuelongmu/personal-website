I developed an FPS movement puzzler for the Unreal Spring Game Jam in June 2020. Titled Antifreeze, the core mechanic is freezing or melting objects using a Portal-inspired gun.

The game was developed over the course of five days with a team of three developers including myself, and itâ€™s currently available for free download on [itch.io](https://xuelongmu.itch.io/antifreeze). You can also check out this gameplay clip!
