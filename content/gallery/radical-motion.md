At [Radical Motion](https://www.getrad.co), I developed a LiveLink integration using C/C++ for Radical Studio, a desktop app that uses deep learning to generate real-time 3D animation data from video. The LiveLink integration allows the animation data to be live streamed to an Unreal Engine editor session, and the data can then be applied to a character in a 3D scene.

I demonstrate the functionality and setup process for the integration in this tutorial video:
