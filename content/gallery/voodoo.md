At Voodoo Manufacturing, I developed a 6DOF robot that can trim clear plastic aligners to sub-millimeter accuracy using an ABB robot with the ROS framework (C++ and Python). I owned the project and was responsible for all aspects including path planning, simulation, calibration, , digital I/O, and cloud integration using WebSockets.

See the robot in action!
