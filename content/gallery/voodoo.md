At Voodoo Manufacturing, I developed a 6DOF robot that can trim clear plastic aligners to sub-millimeter accuracy using an ABB robot with the ROS framework (C++ and Python). I owned the project and was responsible for all aspects including path planning, simulation, calibration, , digital I/O, and cloud integration using WebSockets.

See the robot in action!

During a previous internship at Voodoo while in school, I also developed a 6DOF robot arm to operate a cell of nine 3D printers using ROS with Python and OpenCV. The hardware consists of a Universal Robots UR10 arm, Robotiq gripper, and Basler machine vision camera.

Here's a demo video:
