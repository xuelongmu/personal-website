Pulled Over is a 360-degree narrative short film about four high school students drive home from practice when a routine traffic stop takes a turn for the worse.

It's the story for many black Americans for whom prejudice is an everyday occurrence; whether itâ€™s a suspicious gaze or tragic act of violence.

For people whose skin color grants them immunity from unjustified scrutiny, it can be difficult to imagine what experiencing discrimination is like. I made this film to foster more empathy and understanding of the oppressions black Americans face.
